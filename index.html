        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            My Education has an interesting story. I have always had a problem
            with school and learning was such a challenge for me. In elementary
            school, I failed the 3rd grade and always found myself in the
            principal’s office. I was such a troublemaker fitting the Hispanic
            attitude for school, authority and learning. I dropped out of high
            school during my junior year. I felt like another statistic of Hispanic
            dropouts, and I even ended up working construction right after I left.
            After being homeless for several months, I decided to attend the National
            External Diploma Program at SCC at which point I obtained my high school
            diploma after several weeks of studying. A few weeks after, I took the
            ASVAB and a few months after that I was shipped off to boot camp. After
            my time in the Marines, I attended Green River College where I studied
            Software Development for 2 quarters. I did not continue because the VA
            was scheduling doctors’ appointments through my class time and I missed
            about 3 weeks of school causing me to fall back. My instructor told me
            after I sought help, that it was on me and if I could not catch up, to
            just drop the class. This discouraged me and I just left to pursue
            something different. I attended 4 K-9 schools a year or so after that
            launched my K-9 career through the roof. My First school was called
            Universal K-9 which I attended for 3 months. 2 weeks before graduating,
            my school was raided by the FBI for fraud and aggravated identity theft
            and a few other counts. Sadly, the school was shut down and I did not
            graduate but the experience was great. Mainly watching the FBI raid my
            school. I then was contacted by another in-state K-9 school that took
            me in and certified me with no charge. I then attended a school in
            Virginia called American K-9 Interdiction for another 2 month and this
            is where I received my first K-9 partner Javelin. After attending this
            school, I went on to attend my last K-9 school called Custom K-9
            Unlimited. I was at this school for 2 months at which I received my
            second K-9 partner Copper. Fast forwarding to the present, I am now
            attending Code Fellows for my second attempt at Software Development.
